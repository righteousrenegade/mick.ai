TRAINER MICK.AI
=========

This is the directory/module that implements the training capabilities for generating your own AI model.

This should probably be considered a branching, but much improved version of the previous scripts. I'll leave the old scripts here in a /deprecated/ directory for housekeeping and posterity. But the synthetic_dat_gen python files have been entirely superseded by a much improved collection of scripts, generated largely with the help of Claude 3.7 Sonnet \<3
