TRAINER MICK.AI
=========

This is the directory/module that implements the training capabilities for generating your own AI model.

This should probably be considered a branching, but much improved version of the previous scripts. I'll leave the old scripts here in a /deprecated/ directory for housekeeping and posterity. But the synthetic_dat_gen python files have been entirely superseded by a much improved collection of scripts, generated largely with the help of Claude 3.7 Sonnet \<3


FEATURES
-------------
There are four main files/scripts in this incarnation of Mick.AI: 
* processdata.py -- takes a source txt file of raw data and runs it through a local LLM to generate synthetic training data
* cleandata.py -- takes the file generated by processdata.py and cleans up the Q/A pairs to enable them for gpt2-medium training format
* train.py -- uses the output from cleandata.py to train a new model on. if you have CUDA available this can take mere MINUTES to train.
* chat.py -- USE YOUR NEW MODEL!!!! CHAT WITH IT!

If you are starting from scratch to train a model, you will generally use the above scripts in the listed order.



INSTALLATION
-------------
you should just be able to create a virtualenvironment, install dependencies, and train away.

> python3 -m venv venv
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> source venv/bin/activate # venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 on windows
> python processdata.py # needs a running llm to connect to, or an api
> python cleandata.py
> python train.py
> python chat.py
